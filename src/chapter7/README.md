# Basic Shell Scripting

## Hello, World

So far we only executed straightforward commands in the terminal.
This is enough for simple cases, but not for more intricate scenarios.

For example, we might want to execute a sequence of commands after each other, chain commands together, repeat commands or maybe even execute commands conditionally.

We can achieve this by writing **shell scripts**.
These are similar to scripts written in other programming languages (like Python or JavaScript).
You write a bunch of code, which you can then execute to accomplish some task.

To see how this works, let's create a very simple example script `example.sh` with the following content:

```sh
echo "Hello, world!"
```

We can execute that example script by running:

```sh
sh test.sh
```

This will output `Hello, world!` to the terminal.

> Note that the word "shell" is used both to describe the terminal as well as a programming language that can be used to write a shell script.

## Choosing Your Flavour

There are many different shells available for Linux - `sh`, `bash`, `ksh`, `csh` and `fish` are just a few examples.

We will primarily focus on `sh` and `bash`.
The `sh` shell is an older shell whose features later became standardized in the so-called **POSIX standard**.
The `bash` shell is a newer shell that implements all features of `sh` and has some additional functionality on top of that.

We will primarily talk about the POSIX-compliant parts of bash.
If some `bash` feature is not POSIX-compliant, we will explicitly mention it.

Since there are many different shells, it is often a good practice to add a **shebang** on top of your shell to specify how your script should be executed.
For example, if we want to execute our script with `sh` we would specify the location of `sh` as the shebang:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "Hello, world!"
```

Alternatively, we could specify that our script should be executed with `bash` like this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"
```

Shebangs are a good idea because often scripts are executed not via `sh` or `bash` but by marking them as executable and then simply specifying the path:

```sh
chmod u+x example.sh
./example.sh
```

The shebang will make sure that the script will be executed by the correct interpreter.

## Variables

Variables are declared using the `variable=value` notation.
You can then use the variable by prefixing it with the `$` character.

Unlike most other programming languages, `sh` doesn't really have the concept of a data type.
All variables are strings, but, depending on the context, you can do arithmetic operations and comparisons.
Basically, if a variable contains only digits, it can be treated as a number.

Consider this example script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# You can assign a string to a variable.
# If the string contains no whitespaces, you don't need
# to put it in quotes, although it's usually recommended to do so.
short_username=John
echo $short_username

short_username_2="John"
echo $short_username_2

long_username="John Doe"
echo $long_username

# The number variable is still a string, but you can do numeric operations on it,
# as we will see later
number=1
echo $number
```

This will output the following:

```
John
John
John Doe
1
```

You can use variables inside strings like this:

```sh
# You can use a variable in a string if you prefix it with $
echo "Hello, $short_username"

# You can also surround the variable with curly braces
# in ambiguous expressions
echo "Hello, ${short_username}1"
```

This will output the following:

```
Hello, John
Hello, John1
```

An extremely common error that beginners make is adding spaces in assignments:

```sh
username = "John"
```

This doesn't work and will result in an error:

```sh
./example.sh: line 1: username: command not found
```

It's important to understand that the shell is _extremely permissive_.
All variables that don't exist at the time of usage will be automatically created.

This can lead to problems.
For example, if you mistype a variable, you won't get an error.
Instead, the shell will silently create a new variable:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

username="John Doe"

# This will output an empty string
echo $usernam
```

## Command Substitution

You can use the output of a command in your script via the **command substitution** mechanism.
The syntax for this is `$(command)`.

For example, here is how you can store the output of `ls` in a variable `ls_output`:

```sh
ls_output=$(ls)
echo $ls_output
```

## Arithmetic

The shell supports the usual arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo) and `**` (exponentiation).

You can perform arithmetic expansion using the `$((expression))` notation:

```sh
echo $((5 + 2)) # 7
echo $((5 - 2)) # 3
echo $((5 * 2)) # 10
echo $((5 / 2)) # 2
echo $((5 % 2)) # 1
echo $((5 ** 2)) # 25
```

Note that division is truncated to integers and arithmetic expansion only supports integers.

For example, trying to do this will result in a syntax error:

```sh
echo $((5.2))
```

## Functions

Just like most other programming languages, `sh` supports functions.

However, you should not think about shell functions the same way you would think about e.g. Python or JavaScript functions.
Instead, you should think of shell functions as a kind of "mini-scripts" (or "mini-commands").
This is also why `sh` functions have a peculiar syntax for passing arguments or returning values.

You can define a function like this:

```sh
function_name() {
    # commands
}
```

You can call the function by simply writing `function_name` (just like you would call a regular command).

For example:

```sh
greet() {
    echo "Hello, world!"
}

greet
```

This will output `Hello, world!`.

You can also define a function like this:

```sh
function greet {
    echo "Hello, world!"

greet
}
```

> This is a `bash` extension and not POSIX-compliant.

If you need to pass parameters to a function, you don't write `greet(arg1, arg2)`.
Instead, arguments passed to a function can be accessed using `$1`, `$2` etc:

```sh
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "World"
```

This will output `Hello, world!`.

Here is an example with multiple parameters:

```sh
add() {
    sum=$(($1 + $2 + $3))
    echo "Sum is: $sum"
}

# Call the function with 5, 10 and 15 as arguments
add 5 10 15
```

If you want to return a value from a function, you can `echo` it and then capture the output via command substitution:

```sh
greet() {
    echo "Hello, world!"
}

greeting=$(greet)
echo $greeting
```

> Note that there is also the `return` keyword which allows you to exit a function with a status code.

An important point with `bash` and most other `sh` dialects is that variables are global by default, even if they're created in a function body:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

fun() {
    # Create a variable in the function body
	x=42
    # This will output 42
    echo "In body: $x"
}

# Call the function
fun

# This will also output 42
echo "Outside body: $x"
```

If you want to create a local variable in `bash`, you need to explicitly use the `local` keyword:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

fun() {
    # Create a variable in the function body
	local x=42
    echo "In body: $x"
}

# Call the function
fun

# Here $x will be an empty string
echo "Outside body: $x"
```

## Conditionals

You can use the `if`, `elif` and `else` keywords for conditional behaviour:

```sh
if [ condition1 ]; then
    # commands for condition1
elif [ condition2 ]; then
    # commands for condition2
else
    # commands if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
fi
```

Make sure that there is a space after `[` and a space before `]`.

The conditions must be expressions that evaluate to true or false.
Here, you can use comparison operators like `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt` and `-ge` for numeric comparisons.
For example:

```sh
age=14

if [ $age -lt 17 ]; then
	echo "No drinks for you!"
elif [ $age -eq 17 ]; then
	echo "So close!"
else
	echo "Have fun!"
fi
```

You can also use the operators `=`, `!=` for equality comparisons.
For example:

```sh
number="one"

if [ $number = "one" ]; then
    echo "We are number one!"
elif [ $number = "two" ]; then
    echo "We are number two!"
else
    echo ":("
fi
```

You can also use the `-a` (and), `-o` (or) and the `!` (not) operators to combine conditions.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

user="admin"
logged_in="true"

if [ $user = "admin" -a $logged_in = "true" ]; then
    echo "Welcome, admin!"
fi
```

Bash introduces additional syntax that looks more like conditionals in other programming languages.
You can write `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]` to allow for operators like `&&` (and), `||` (or) and `==` (similar to `=` with additional pattern matching features).
For instance, the previous example could be written like this in Bash:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

user="admin"
logged_in="true"

if [[ $user == "admin" && $logged_in == "true" ]]; then
    echo "Welcome, admin!"
fi
```

This syntax looks much more similar to other programming languages.

## Loops

The shell supports most familiar loops like `while` and `for`.

A `while` loop constantly checks whether a condition is met.
If the condition isn't met, the while loop terminates.

The general syntax for a `while` loop looks like this:

```sh
while [ condition ]; do
    # commands to execute
done
```

For example:

```sh
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo $count
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

A shell-specific loop is the `until` loop which is a kind of the opposite of the `while` loop.
A `while` loop continues until a condition _is no longer true_.
The `until` loop continues until a condition _is true_.

Here is how we could rewrite the example using an `until` loop:

```sh
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do
    echo $count
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

The general syntax for a `for` loop looks like this:

```sh
for item in list; do
    # commands to execute
done
```

For example:

```sh
for i in 1 2 3; do
    echo $i
done
```

Here is how you could use a `for` loop to iterate over the current files in a directory:

```sh
for file in $(ls); do
    echo "$file"
done
```

You could also iterate over the lines in a file:

```sh
for word in $(cat filename); do
    echo "$word"
done
```

You can use the `break` keyword to exit from a loop:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo $count
    if [ $count -eq 3 ]; then
        break # Exit the loop when count equals 3
    fi
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

You can use the `continue` keyword to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and continue with the next iteration:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

count=0
while [ $count -lt 5 ]; do
    echo $count
    if [ $count -eq 3 ]; then
        continue # Skip the rest of the loop when count equals 3
    fi
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

## Stdin, Stdout and Stderr

In Linux, the standard way programs communicate with their environment is through the three data streams called **stdin** (short for standard input), **stdout** (short for standard output) and **stderr** (short for standard error).

Specifically, they send results to stdout and errors to stderr, while reading input from stdin.
Internally, these streams are referenced by the file descriptor numbers `0` (stdin), `1` (stdout), `2` (stderr).

For example, when your program "writes something to the console", it actually sends data to `stdout`:

```sh
echo "This is sent to stdout"
```

When your program "reads user input", it actually reads input from `stdin`:

```sh
read -p "Read a value from stdin: " input
echo $input
```

You can use **I/O redirection** to redirect a stream by using the `>`, `>>` and `<` operators.

For example, you can redirect stdout to a file like this:

```sh
echo "This will be written to example.txt" > example.txt
```

The difference between `>` and `>>` is that `>` will overwrite the file, while `>>` will append to the file.
Consider this example:

```sh
echo -n "This first line will be overwritten" > example.txt
echo "Second line" > example.txt
```

The resulting file will look like this:

```
Second line
```

Now consider this example:

```sh
echo "This first line will not be overwritten" >> example.txt
echo "Second line" >> example.txt
```

The resulting file will look like this:

```
This first line will not be overwritten
Second line
```

We can also use `>` to redirect `stdout` to `stderr` via the `1>&2` notation.
For example, here is how we can write something to `stderr`:

```sh
echo "This will be written to stderr" 1>&2
```

We can also use `>` to redirect stderr to stdout via the `2>&1` notation.

This is usually useful in cases where you want to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file using `> filename 2>&1`.
Note that the order of the redirects is important here:

First, we redirect `stdout` to `filename`.
Second, we redirect `stderr` to `stdout`.
Since `stdout` is redirected to `filename`, `stderr` will also be redirected to `filename`.

> We can also use the `>` operator to create the world's simplest text editor by running `cat > output`.

We can use the `<` operator to redirect stdin.
Consider this script that reads a line from a user and outputs it back:

```sh
read -p "Enter a line:" line
echo $line
```

If you want to read that line from a file instead, you can create a new file containing the line and then use `<` to redirect `stdin` from the file:

```
sh example.sh < example.txt
```

## Pipe Operator

The pipe operator `|` can be used to pipe stdout of one command to stdin of another command.

Consider the following two scripts.
The first script `generate.sh` generates numbers from 1 to 5 and writes them to stdout:

```sh
seq 1 5
```

Now, consider a second script `square.sh` that reads numbers from stdin and prints their squares:

```sh
while read number; do
  echo $((number * number))
done
```

You can use the `|` operator to pass the output of `generate.sh` to `square.sh`:

```
./generate.sh | ./square.sh
```

This will output:

```
1
4
9
16
25
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are special variables that are defined outside your script.
They are part of the environment in which the script runs.
These variables contain information related to the system or user environment.

For example, the `USER` environment variable contains the current user and `HOME` the home directory of the current user:

```sh
echo $USER
echo $HOME
```

The `SHELL` environment variable contains the path to the current shell:

```sh
# Outputs /bin/bash if you're using bash
echo $SHELL
```

One particularly important environment variable is the `$PATH` variable.
This specifies the directories that the shell traverses when looking for executable files when you enter a command.

The directories are separated by colons.
For example, `$PATH` might be `/bin:/usr/bin:/home/username/.local/bin`.
In this case, the shell would look for files in `/bin`, `/usr/bin` and `/home/username/.local/bin`.
This means that if you have file `/usr/bin/thingy` and you type `thingy` in your command line, the shell will be able to locate and execute that file.

You can also set your own environment variables temporarily using the `export` command:

```sh
export VAR_NAME=varvalue
```

The variable will be set for the duration of the session (e.g. if you close the terminal, it will be lost).
Your scripts will be able to access the variable `VAR_NAME`.

You can use `printenv` to print the currently set environment variables.

## Should you use `bash`?

Since `bash` is theoretically not POSIX-compliant, there a some people who advocate against using bash (at least the non-compliant features).

However, these days `bash` is available on practically any useful Linux distribution.
In our opinion, you should absolutely use `bash` (including the non-compliant features) unless you really have to support some ancient Linux distribution.
